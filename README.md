# Weather Dashboard

Search any city to get the current weather and a five-day forecast!

## Description

This project's objective was to build a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to pull data from OpernWeather's API. This project contains a search input field for a user to search any city, which returns a card displaying the current weather of that searched city. Underneath is a five-day forecast, with five cards, labeled with the corresponding date of that five-day forecast. On the left-hand side, there is a previously searched section with a button representing that previous search. Upon clicking, it will display the forecast again for that city, as if it were searched again.
